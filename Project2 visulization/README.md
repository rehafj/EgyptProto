# EgyptProto


This project will contain proof of concept for the  Saqqara project.  For testing/playing purposes please include scenes with your names. Will update this as the project evolves. 

###### note:
to avoid mismatching editor errors in unity please use unity 2018 v2.11f1 


##### warning 

to avoid loss of data on main scenes 
1. make sure you are working on the dev branch 
2. make sure you pull the latest version on the dev branch before starting
3. state on our slack channel that you are on the main scene 
    1. if anyone is on the scene wait until they push their scenes up ( other wise scene data could be lost ) 
    2. once you are done with the main scene, push it to the dev branch 
    3. state on slack that you are done with the main scene additions 
    4. update the branch on GitHub 

—— 
if you are working on your own scenes it should be fine 
for a good work flow, add your own dummy scene with your name on it instead of working directly in the main scene, once done and it works adapt it into main scenes ( dev branch ) and go to step 1

---
please remember to pull the latest from the dev branch before starting
